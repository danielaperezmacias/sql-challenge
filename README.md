DATA MODELING: 
Inspect the CSV files, and then sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables. To create the sketch, feel free to use a tool like QuickDBDLinks to an external site

-ERD is in the folder named "ERD" that has the diagram image and documentation of the making of the image. 

DATA ENGINEERING: 
Use the provided information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Be sure to do the following:

Remember to specify the data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.

For the primary keys, verify that the column is unique. Otherwise, create a composite keyLinks to an external site., which takes two primary keys to uniquely identify a row.

Be sure to create the tables in the correct order to handle the foreign keys.

Import each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.

-This can be seen in the tables schemata.sql file (for code). Results can be found in Tables Created from Tables Schemata.
